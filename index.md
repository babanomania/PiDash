## Setup on the Raspberry Pi

### Testing the Code

- Install nodejs on your pi using the below command

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt-get install nodejs
  sudo apt-get install npm
  ```
  
- Install nodejs on your pi using the below command

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt-get install git
  ```
  
- Then clone the repo

  ```bash
  mkdir ~/PiDash
  cd ~/PiDash
  git clone https://github.com/babanomania/PiDash.git .
  ```

- Run the nodejs server and test

  ```bash
  npm i
  npx next build
  npx next start -p 8080
  ```
  
  Then, Open [http://192.168.0.104:3000](http://192.168.0.104:3000) with your browser where 192.168.0.104 is your PI's ip.
  
  nb: Here running the build command is an important step, it will build the project to run faster,
  once you run this step, the application can be run anytime using the start command

- To Start the server on a different path say 8181 use the below commands

  ```bash
  npx next build
  npx next start -p 8181
  ```

  Then, Open [http://192.168.0.104:8181](http://192.168.0.104:8181) with your browser where 192.168.0.104 is your PI's ip.

### Customizing Applications List

  PiDash has an feature to show an applications list via the navigation bar on the top, to customize a list of applications you can edit the `shortcut.config.js` file as per your needs

### Setting it as a Service

- Create a PiDash.service file as below

  ```
  [Unit]
  Description=PiDash Service
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/PiDash
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/npx next start -p 8080
  Restart=on-failure
  User=pi

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```
  
- Now copy this file to the /etc/systemd/system directory
  
    ```bash
    sudo cp timestamp.service /etc/systemd/system
    
- Then enable the service
  
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable PiDash.service
    ```
    
- Viewing Service Logs
    
    Instead of logging to standard out on the console, systemd is now managing our serviceâ€™s logging. Logs can be viewed as follows

    ```bash
    journalctl -u PiDash
    ```
    
That's it! Your PiDash service is currently up and running and in case of a restart it will start automatically when the system boots.
